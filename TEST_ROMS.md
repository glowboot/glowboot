# Test-ROM accuracy inventory

Results from running the [c-sp Game Boy test-rom collection](https://github.com/c-sp/game-boy-test-roms) through `npm run test:roms`. Updated as suites are exercised; serves both as a regression baseline and as a triage list — entries marked "investigate" are concrete bugs we plan to address; entries marked "expected" are architectural or out-of-scope.

**Test-rom binaries are not bundled.** Fetch the latest release zip from <https://github.com/c-sp/game-boy-test-roms/releases> and unpack into `test-roms/` (gitignored).

### Mealybug PPU — 0 / 30 (5 skipped)

All 30 framebuffer-comparison failures are expected in the current architecture. The mealybug suite tests **mid-mode-3 register changes** (BGP / OBP / LCDC / SCX / SCY changed between specific dot positions of mode 3, with reference images showing the resulting per-pixel raster effect). Glowboot's PPU renders each scanline atomically at end of mode 3, so these effects can't be reproduced without a Pixel-FIFO PPU rewrite.

The pixel-diff counts now serve as quantitative regression markers — fixes can be tracked by watching counts drop.

5 ROMs are skipped because they only ship `_dmg_blob.png` references; Glowboot is CGB-only and the comparison would be apples-to-oranges.

### Bully GB

`290 px diff` — boot-state dependent. Same class as Mooneye `boot_*`.

## Triage candidates (fix before shipping)

- [ ] Mooneye `ret_*` timeouts — three tests hang; likely a real RET timing bug
- [ ] cgb-acid-hell 2-pixel diff — find which pixels and why
- [ ] Mooneye timer `*_div_trigger` (5 tests) — DIV→TIMA trigger edge case
- [ ] Mooneye `*_timing` for CALL/JP/RST/PUSH (~8 tests) — cycle accounting
- [ ] Strikethrough 22 px — close to passing; small fix likely
- [ ] Scribbltests `scxly` 100 % diff — investigate (palette? rendering path off?)
- [ ] GBMicrotest `hblank_int_scx*` cluster — 24 related fails on the same axis
